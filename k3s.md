# **K3s**
## What is it?
After the development of Kubernetes, which was very heavy with a lot of applications, came K3S, which is much lighter in weight because many resources were removed from it that were not useful in k8s, it isavailable and has a very small size. And in addition, it does not change the basic capabilities of Kubernetes
## When should it be used?
I will use K3S and when I need To use Kubernetes(which is actually like an operating system for very large devices (cluster) like server farms) but i dont have enugh resources or I prefer to deal with less weight, Kubernetes solution that easy to deploy, manage, and maintain, especially in environmentes with limited resources.
## Where can it be used?
K3S can be used for several uses:
1. End computers - where resources are limited
2. Development and testing - for developers who want to set up Kubernetes clusters quickly >for development and testing purposes. It is easy to deploy and manage, streamlining the >process of creating isolated environments for testing applications.
3. Production environments - where simplicity and speed of deployment are of utmost >importance. Organizations looking for an easy to manage and maintain Kubernetes distribution >may find K3s useful for running production workloads.
4. Hybrid cloud deployments - Its compatibility with different cloud providers and local >configurations makes it a flexible option for hybrid cloud deployments.
#### K3S works like Kubernetes simply, and does not compromise on functionality or performance
## Why should I use it?
When you need a lightweight Linux distribution that will run in any standard Linux-based environment and if you don't require a specific type of configuration not supported by K3s.
